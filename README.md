E-Commerce-carting

First E-Commerce website for backend . Welcome to the E-Commerce-carting Project :- Milestone 1

This project is an e-commerce application built using the MERN Stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js). It aims to provide hands-on experience with building a full-fledged e-commerce app and understanding core development concepts and tools. The project is designed to help developers learn about API creation, user authentication, product management, and backend development.

Milestone 1: Project Overview

In Milestone 1, we covered the foundation of the e-commerce project:

MERN Stack Overview: Understanding the architecture and how each technology (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) fits into the project.

REST API Introduction: Learning the basics of building scalable APIs for user authentication, product management, and order handling.

Authentication: Setting up secure login and registration processes for users.

Database Schema Design: Exploring MongoDB schema design and how to structure data efficiently.

Project Setup: Initializing the project repository, ensuring proper structure, and preparing for upcoming milestones.

Next Steps

Set up the development environment and install dependencies.

Build the server using Node.js and Express.

Develop and connect REST API endpoints.

Start frontend development with React.

Milestone 2 : Project Setup & Login Page

Objective: Set up the frontend and backend, and create a functional login page.

Key Achievements:

Organized the project by creating separate folders for the frontend and backend codebases.

Initialized the frontend using React to handle the user interface.

Configured the backend with Node.js to handle server requests.

Integrated Tailwind CSS to streamline the styling process for a responsive and modern design.

Designed and implemented a fully functional Login Page, enabling users to sign in to the application.

Milestone 3 : Backend Setup & MongoDB Integration

Objective: Set up the backend server, integrate MongoDB for data storage, and implement error handling for robust operation.

Key Achievements:

Created a structured folder hierarchy for organizing the backend code (routes, controllers, models).

Established a Node.js server using Express to handle incoming requests.

Connected the backend to MongoDB to store user data and other essential information for the application.

Integrated basic error handling to provide clear feedback for debugging and ensure smooth server operation.

Milestone 4 : User Model, Controller & File Uploads

Objective: Create a User Model for handling user data, develop a controller for managing user-related operations, and enable file uploads.

Key Achievements:

Designed a User Model using Mongoose to define the structure of user data (name, email, password, etc.) in the database.

Built a User Controller to handle the user registration and authentication processes.

Set up Multer, a middleware to handle file uploads such as profile pictures, enabling the app to store and manage user files effectively.

Milestone 5 : Sign-Up Page & Form Validation

Objective: Build a user-friendly Sign-Up page for new users and implement form validation to ensure correct data entry.

Key Achievements:

Developed a Sign-Up page with fields for Name, Email, and Password, allowing users to create an account.

Implemented form validation to ensure that users provide valid input, such as checking the email format and enforcing strong password criteria.

The form validates inputs before submission to prevent incorrect or insecure data from being processed.

Milestone 6 : Secure User Data Storage & Password Encryption

Objective: Enhance security by encrypting user passwords before storing them in the database and ensuring all user data is safely handled.

Key Achievements:

Implemented bcrypt to hash passwords before saving them, ensuring that passwords are never stored in plain text.

Saved all user data securely, including encrypted passwords, in the MongoDB database.

Applied best practices for data security, ensuring compliance with privacy standards and protecting user information from unauthorized access.
